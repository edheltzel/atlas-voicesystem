// Issue #38 — behavioral proof of the #25 synth/playback failure-attribution
// rule for edge-tts. The existing guard (tests/core/server-contract-source.test.ts)
// is a STRUCTURAL source assertion: it can't catch a future edit that reintroduces
// a breaker call from the playback path under a different name. This test exercises
// EdgeTTSProvider.speak() for real and asserts the circuit-breaker STATE that
// results, so the attribution rule is verified by behavior, not by grep.
//
// The rule (core/circuit-breaker.ts header, issue #25):
//   • A SYNTHESIS failure is a provider failure → may open the edgetts breaker.
//   • A local PLAYBACK failure (afplay/mpv) is NOT a provider failure → must
//     never open the breaker.
//
// No production change is needed to test this: EdgeTTSProvider is reachable via
// the exported `providers.edgetts` singleton, and both edge-tts channels are
// subprocesses — so routing `node:child_process`.spawn through a swappable impl
// (the pattern from tests/core/egress-gating.test.ts) lets us drive synth and
// playback outcomes independently. speak() calls synthesizeOnce (python -m
// edge_tts) for synthesis and spawn(afplay|mpv) for playback; we classify the
// two by argv and feed each its own scripted outcome.
//
// Config is pinned via env BEFORE import so the breaker math is deterministic and
// independent of the host environment (these are module-load-time consts):
//   • PORT=0                      → ephemeral bind, never collides with :8888.
//   • THRESHOLD=2                 → two recorded failures open the breaker.
//   • SYNTH_RETRIES=1             → one retry, i.e. two synth attempts per speak().
//   • SYNTH_BACKOFF_MS=1          → retry sleep is ~1ms, keeps the suite fast.
//   • AUDIO_CACHE_DIR=<tmp>       → real createAudioTempFile() writes land in a
//                                   scratch dir, not the user's real cache.
